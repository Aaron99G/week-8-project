			<p>Push Pull Legs or PPL is a workout split is where you split the muscle groups that you will workout by those that you use to push/pull and legs on their own</p>
			<p>This one is really good to look more asthetic, but it can be adjusted to focus a bit more on strength</p>

			<p>Upper Lower Split is a workout split where you focus on your upper body muscle one day, and lower body the next</p>
